Some tips:

Don't let one day go by without writing code! Code every day!
Allocate time every day to watch the videos and learn
Plan out an app and start building it as you are learning - building your own apps is one of the best ways to learn
Focus on a few key areas and don't learn a ton of new things. I recommend learning these items and dropping other things
at the same time:
iOS
Swift
Git
Data structures / algorithms
Design Patterns
